COVID-19 DISEASE ASSISTANT

The coronavirus (COVID-19), first appeared in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, which spread rapidly all over the world and became a pandemic. It has a most severe and drastic effect on public effect and global economy. So, It is necessary to detect the positive cases as early as possible as to prevent the further spread of this epidemic. So rapid detection of COVID-19 cases is a significant step to fight against this virus as well as to release pressure off the healthcare system as a reason, radiological examination is one of the possible way to achieve this. Therefore, in this project, a deep learning model has been proposed for detection of COVID-19 using chest x-ray images.
The key features of this project includes to track the COVID-19 outbreak, detect the coronavirus, and get the coronavirus related information with the help of Chabot, etc.. This application is mainly helpful in healthcare sectors for detecting the likelihood of patients getting coronavirus with the help of radiological chest x-ray images. And lastly, the main motto of this project is to provide a user-friendly experience to the users on using this system.
